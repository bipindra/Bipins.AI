# Commit Message Guidelines

## Guidelines

- **Do NOT mention "TODO" in commit messages**
- Use descriptive messages about what was implemented
- Focus on features and improvements, not task tracking

## Good Examples

✅ "Add structured output support to Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, and Bedrock providers"
✅ "Add comprehensive unit tests for VectorFilterBuilder and ChunkingStrategies"
✅ "Fix test compilation errors and complete structured output implementation"
✅ "Add unit tests for StructuredOutputHelper, Cache, and ChunkingStrategyFactory"

## Bad Examples

❌ "Complete TODO #6 - structured output"
❌ "Fix TODO #8 - unit tests"
❌ "19/20 TODO items complete"

## Format

Use imperative mood:
- "Add feature X"
- "Fix issue Y"
- "Update component Z"
- "Implement support for X"
